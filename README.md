# My First iOS App
This was originally my first iOS application, the code is dramatically different from when I first released this on the App Store. I'm a self taught developer initially learning C# at work while always looking write code in Swift in my spare time. 

I originially created this app loosely around MVC, If I could start over I may have structured the database differently, I also removed all pods including the Infinite Layout Pod to impliment an infinite UICollectionView myself. 

Most recently I've been re-writing the whole app (MVVM-C) as I've learnt new design principles and best practices. I've improved this applictaion dramataically from a code perspective and most importantly learned a lot about Swift and the benefits and hurdles of MVVM-C. I'm always endeavouring to learn and improve as a developer, particularly with Swift, any feedback is more than welcome.
