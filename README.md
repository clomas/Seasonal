# My First iOS Ap 
This is my first iOS app, I'm a self taught developer initially learning C# at work while always looking write code in Swift in my spare time. 

# Design Decisions 
I originially created this app loosely around MVC, If I could start over I may have structured the database differently, I also removed all pods including the Infinite Layout Pod to impliment an infinite UICollectionView myself. 

Most recently I've been re-writing the whole app (MVVM-C) as I've learnt new design principles and best practices. I've improved this applictaion dramataically and most importantly learned a lot about Swift and the benefits and hurdles of MVVM-C. I'm always endeavouring to learn and improve as a developer, particularly with Swift, any feedback is more than welcome.
